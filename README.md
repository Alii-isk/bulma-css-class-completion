# Bulma CSS Class Completion
Visual Studio Code extension that provides CSS class name completion for the HTML class attribute based on Bulma CSS classes.

> ðŸš§ Work in progress (in low priority, contributions welcome!).

## Why use it?
Completion based on the parent class. Your workflow will be faster and you will avoid the headache of searching for all available classes.

If the attribute has a parent class like "card", it will suggest classes based on the parent, otherwise it will display the list of all available classes.
